# Diploma Blockchain

This repository contains our implementations of various blockchain algorithms. It serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding and implementing blockchain technology.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following blockchain algorithms:

- sha256 hashing algorithm


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

 - to clone the repository in your local machine, and to run and test the code, you will need to have the following softwares installed:
	```
	> git
	> a C compiler
	> a python interpreter
	```


### Installing

 - first you will have to clone the repository using:
 ```
 	git clone https://github.com/imranboutadghart/diploma-blockchain
 ```

## Running the tests

- to test sha256 hashing algorithm, run the following commands:
	```
		CC sha256.c -o sha256
		./sha256 <file to be hashed>
	```

## Built With

* C 		- The language for sha256
* python 	- for other algorithms
